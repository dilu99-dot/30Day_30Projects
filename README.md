📁 30 Days, 30 JavaScript Projects

Welcome to the 30 Days 30 Projects challenge! 🚀

This repository contains a collection of 30 beginner-to-intermediate level JavaScript projects, built one per day over a month-long coding sprint. Each project is crafted to help reinforce core concepts of vanilla JavaScript—from DOM manipulation and event handling to local storage, API integration, and interactive UI features.

🛠 What You'll Find
💡 Daily Projects: A new JS project for each day (e.g., to-do app, calculator, quiz game, countdown timer, etc.)
🧠 Core Concepts: Focus on JavaScript fundamentals like arrays, objects, loops, functions, and more
🎨 Simple UI: Minimal HTML/CSS to highlight JS functionality
🔄 Reusable Logic: Clean, readable code that’s easy to adapt and expand
🧰 No Libraries: Pure vanilla JS—no frameworks or libraries

📦 Structure

🎯 Goal
To practice, learn, and build consistently—one day, one project at a time—and become more confident with JavaScript.
